# Memento mori

_I really wished I knew my way around JavaScript._

A simple week based calendar displaying the weeks you already lived and the weeks you may have left.

## Config

Configure basic stuff via `js/config.js`

```javascript
const data = {
  birthday: "1980-01-01",
  numberOfYears: 85,
  specialDates: [
    ["1987-08-01", "Some arbitrary summer day", "dodgerblue"],
    ["1989-12-24", "Some arbitrary christmas eve", "gold"],
  ],
};
```

## Run

Deploy it to a HTTP server or run it in your dev environment.
